Sales Quote Generator — Chrome extension (side panel)
======================================================

Build sales quotes with volume pricing, discounts, renewals, and
configurable pricing rules — right in the browser side panel, next to
whatever page you're working on. Fully self-contained: no network
access, no external dependencies. Requires Chrome 114+.

HOW TO LOAD (unpacked)
----------------------
1. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions
2. Turn ON "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select this folder (sales-quote-generator)
5. Click the extension's toolbar icon — the quote generator opens
   in the browser side panel (click the icon again, or the side
   panel's × button, to close it)

USING THE TOOL
--------------
- The gear icon in the header switches between the quote calculator
  and the pricing settings screen.
- Settings changes apply to the calculator immediately.
- The running total lives in the dock at the bottom of the panel.
  Tap it to slide up the full quote breakdown (line items, discounts,
  billing schedule, savings); tap the dimmed area, the ×, or press
  Escape to close it.
- "Create quote" downloads a one-page branded quote PDF (line items,
  discounts, billing schedule, total contract value, and signature
  lines), named after the quote number (e.g. QT-2026-1234.pdf).
- The in-progress quote and all pricing settings are saved to this
  browser (localStorage) and restored automatically when you reopen
  the panel. Use "Reset to default pricing" on the settings screen to
  restore the built-in rate tables and rules.
